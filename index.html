<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" target="_blank"><p>
The <i> dog </i> is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. 
Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, 
and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. 
<u> Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago 
    before the development of agriculture.</u>
